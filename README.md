# labelsCollectiveAccess

I needed a spot to store and share the label templates I made for the collection management software, CollectiveAccess. If you want to use the actual software for
the program, please see https://github.com/collectiveaccess 

These files should be uploaded and stored in providence/app/printTemplates/labels/local

2023 Update
I need to work on organizing this git as I should avoid using it like google drive. Anyway, I wanted to point out the two older Chinhall Nomenclature XLSX files are 

Â© Rowman & Littlefield and Government of Canada, Canadian Heritage Information Network.

I am posting them under the creative commons licence so that others using CollectiveAccess will be able to install the nomenclature intergration in the event the current file does not work.
