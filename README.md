# labelsCollectiveAccess

I needed a spot to store and share the label templates I made for the collection management software, CollectiveAccess. If you want to use the actual software for
the program, please see https://github.com/collectiveaccess 

These files should be uploaded and stored in providence/app/printTemplates/labels/local
